        <li><h3>Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):</h3>
        <p>x = 1; <br>
            var a = 5; <br>
            var b = 10; <br>
            var c = function(a, b, c) { <br>
            document.write(b); } <br>
            c(8,9,10); document.write(b); document.write(x); <br>
            } <br>
            var x = 10; document.write(x); document.write(a); <br>
            var f = function(a, b, c) { <br>
            } f(a,b,c); <br>
            b = a; document.write(b); b = c; <br>
            var x = 5; </p> <br>
            <p>Ans: 10 8 8 9 10 1</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>What is the difference between a method and function?</h3>
        <p>Ans: Function is a block of code written to perform specific task defined using function keyword followed by function name and can live by its own.
                Methods is a function associated with an object property. The method operates on the data contained in a class. The function can be called directly <br>
                by its name whereas method can be called by object name and method name using dot notation.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</h3>
        <p>Ans: 'this' refers to the object of current class.</p></li>

        <li><h3>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</h3>
            <p>Ans: 'this' refers to the owner object of that method.</p></li>

        <li><h3>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</h3>
        <p>Ans: In constructor function 'this' refers to the new object when a new object is created.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</h3>
        <p>
            Ans: 'this' refers to x.

        </p></li>

        <li><h3>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the

        <p> Ans:   var obj = { <br>
            name: "fred", <br>
            major: "music", <br>

                if(a == b){ <br>
                    return Math.sqrt(a*b); <br>
                } <br>
                else if(a > b){ <br>
                    return b; <br>

            this.name = name; <br>

        var emp1 = new Employee("Kabin", 1000, "Clerk");</p></li>

                var product = 1; <br>
                for(let i=0; i < arguments.length; i++){ <br>
                  product *= arguments[i]; <br>
              } <br>
              return product; <br>
            } <br>
            var result = findProduct(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7); <br>
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = result; <br>
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</h3>
        <p>Ans:
            var f = (a, b, c) => { <br>
                if(a >= b && a >= c){ <br>
              return a; <br>
              }else if(b >= a && b >= c){ <br>
                  return b; <br>
              }else if(c>= a && c >= b){ <br>
              return c; <br>
              } <br>
            } <br>
